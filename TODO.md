1. Update style to match the [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) by Miguel Grinberg (DONE, I think)
2. Change back from flask-bootstrap (bootstrap3) to just using regular bootstrap4 so I don't need to change my original HTML code (DONE)
3. Create new Calendar Class inherited from [calendar](https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html) to keep new calendar functions. (DONE)
4. Add more tests. (TODO)
5. Add recurring tasks using [dateutil](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with RRULE. (TODO)
